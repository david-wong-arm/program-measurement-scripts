0. Installation and setup of Docker 
  A.  Install Docker
  B.  Add user to docker group (e.g. usermod -a -G docker <username>)
  C.  Update container/LocalDockerfile to install extra package for local container
    • Make sure http_proxy and https_proxy variables are set correctly if behind VPN
   D.  If behind a proxy, need to do the following steps: (from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69048671/how-to-use-docker-login-with-a-proxy)
       1) Create a systemd directory for the docker service
             - sudo mkdir -p /etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d
       2) Create configuration file for proxy (/etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d/http-proxy.conf).  An example below:

# File: /etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d/http-proxy.conf
# File: /etc/systemd/docker.service.d/http-proxy.conf
[Service]
Environment="HTTP_PROXY=proxy-chain.intel.com:911"
Environment="NO_PROXY=localhost,127.0.0.1"
       3) Restart daemons
          - sudo systemctl daemon-reload
          - sudo systemctl restart docker

1 Some pre-steps to take before checking out the packages:
  A.  Ensure OS can fix CPU frequencies via userspace power governor (see below)
  B.  Install EMON package (with API support) to /opt/intel/sep. 
      (The script does look for /opt/intel/sep, so make sure the package is 
      installed there. You can use a softlink to point to the real 
      location if desired.)
    • tar xvf emon_api_linux_alpha2_1.tar.bz2
    • sudo cp -R emon_api_linux_alpha2_1 /opt/intel/sep
    • cd /opt/intel/sep/sepdk/src
    • sudo ./build-driver
    • sudo ./insmod-sep -g emon-user-group
    • Later as a regular user to run the script, you need to do the following 
      command to load the enviromental variables to run it:
        • source /opt/intel/sep/sep_var.sh
  C.  Install Intel C/C++/Fortran compilers and source the corresponding 
      variable setting scripts so the compilers are in your PATH.

Note that 
• For A, there are two ways to enable OS to manage CPU frequencies
    1) Change the BIOS of the system so that P-States will be managed by OS. 
       The exact menu choice is machine dependent.
    2) If 1) does not work, disable the intel_pstate driver by adding 
       "intel_pstate=disable" to your kernel boot line.
  To double check whether you are in good shape, look 
  at /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_available_governors and see 
  whether userspace governor is in the list. g.g.
  cwong29@fxilab163:codeletProbe> cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_available_governors

• For B (EMON installation), the step assumed you created a user group to 
  run EMON and you add those who want to run EMON to this group. 
  (It does not have to be called “emon-user-group”.)
• For many of our previous experiments, we turn off hyperthreading.  
  If you want to reproduce our previous results, you may want to do that off in 
  BIOS too.  However, for running experiments in general, you can keep it on.
• If there are multiple versions of Python installed, please make sure the 
  default version points to the latest version at least Python 3.6   .

After the above presteps, you should be ready to install the experimental 
scripts and our NR-codelet set.  Below I assume a common directory <home> 
containing both the experiment script and codelets as follows:

<home>
• cape-experiment-scripts
• nr-codelets

2. Checkout/initialization steps
  A.  Checkout Cape-Experiment-Script
    • cd <home>
    • git clone git@gitlab.com:davidwong/cape-experiment-scripts.git

  B.  Checkout NR-codelets
    • cd <home>
    • git clone git@gitlab.com:davidwong/nr-codelets.git

  C.  Initialize scripts.
    • cd <home>/cape-experiment-scripts
    • ./setup.sh

3. Test steps
Now you should be ready to start running the experiments.  There are many 
examples under cape-experiment-scripts/vrun. (Some are outdated.) 
To try the experiment script on your system, you can run the following command:
  • cd <home>/cape-experiment-scripts/vrun
  • ./vrun_fxilab163_FP.sh "test"

Note that the “Test” argument is the description for the experiment. 
You can put whatever meaningful to you. 
It will be saved under cape-experiment-scripts/vrun/log.*.txt file. 
It is useful to look at that file to look for experimental ID when you want to 
revisit some old runs in the future. After running the script, if it is 
successful, you will see something like the following:

------------------------------------------------------------
Cape data saved in: /localdisk/cwong29/working/tmp/cape-experiment-scripts/vrun/logs/runs/1516134080/cape_1516134080.csv
./vrun_fxilab163_FP.sh finished in 00:34:19 at Tue Jan 16 14:55:39 CST 2018

It may be best to make sure that all steps of the script finished successfully 
as well by checking the output of the script as it runs (data being saved 
doesn't necessarily mean the run was good).

Here the data file 
/localdisk/cwong29/working/tmp/cape-experiment-scripts/vrun/logs/runs/1516134080/cape_1516134080.csv 
contains the experimental data.

4. Some advice of container usage
Since the container starts and stops SEP driver automatically to ensure a clean driver usage, exiting container improperly (e.g. by disconnecting from an SSH session) will cause imcomplete shutdown of SEP driver.   To avoid that, it is suggested user to use tools like VNC (GUI) or screen (textual) to provide resumable sessioning of connection.
